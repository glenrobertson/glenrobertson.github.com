<p>
I am a full-stack software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.<br />
I have worked exclusively in iOS for the last 18 months, but prior to that I have worked in back-end roles.</p>
<p>
I am empathetic, pragmatic and product focused. I care about the customer, and I am motivated by solving techical problems to help them.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> | iOS Engineer | California + New York | December 2017 - Current</h4>
<p>
<h5>Identity team</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Ride for others: 9% of rides are requested for another person. I wrote a tech spec, and built this new feature for riders to request a ride for someone else. This involved modifying critical ride request code, working with RxSwift, as well as Lyft's internal Flow and Plugin architectures.</li>
    <li>Driver selfie challenges: implemented UI flow to enforce potential fraudulent drivers to verify their face and driver license against their driver account. This reduced risky rides from 440k to 72k per week.</li>
    <li>Bikeshare account linking: implemented integration from the iOS rider profile to a web flow, allowing riders to link their bikeshare accounts (Citibike, Ford GoBike, etc).</li>
    <li>Rider profile: proposed and built a rider profile screen. This unlocked name editing, increased email verifications and profile photo uploads. 138k riders verified their email after viewing the profile over a 45 day period.</li>
    <li>Pronouns: implemented <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18646740/lyft-pronoun-choice-app-lgbtq-pride">rider pronouns</a> with a tight deadline for the pride parades in 2019. 445k iOS riders have added pronouns since launch. This unlocked the ability for drivers to see the rider pronouns.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> | Server Engineer | California | May 2013 - Dec 2017</h4>
<h5>Identity team</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Driver account takeover: built set of fraud rules that prevented social engineering attacks against drivers. This saved the company over $1M/week in loss of driver earnings. I worked closely with the risk operations team to understand the takeover methods. I then implemented fraud rules to detect fraudulent phrases in phone calls from riders to drivers. I built SMS challenges to confirm payment method updates and payouts. <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/stopping-fraudsters-by-changing-products-452240f2d2cc?gi=ae4fa353f3">Blog post here.</a></li>
    <li>Monolithic decomposition: helped with a company wide initiative to move code from the legacy PHP codebase into smaller Python services. This involved careful planning in multiple phases to avoid any downtime. I moved account related code, as well as phone call routing logic without any causing any outages. I took the opportunity to identify and remove unnecessary code, which shed 38% of traffic from the new users service.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Enterprise team</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Organizations: implemented Python service and data model to store organizations and employee work emails, as well as a web frontend to allow employers to provide Lyft perks to their employees. These were:
        <ol>
            <li>Credits: configurable by geofence, time window, and amount.</li>
            <li>Direct billing: a proxy payment method to bill to the employer's account.</li>
            <li>Offline accounts: this allowed higher volume organizations to accrue charges on a monthly basis.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Business profiles: technical lead for <a href="https://lyft.com/business">business profiles</a>. I wrote a tech spec, seeked consensus with client engineers, and built the back-end APIs. More than 1.4M Lyft riders have added business profiles. I also built the back-end API to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-lyft-receipt">generate PDF reports of business rides for expensing purposes</a>.</li>
    <li>Concierge: built API for web-based <a href="https://support.lyftbusiness.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018624554-Send-rides-for-your-people-with-Concierge">concierge tool</a> where organizations could request rides for others. It involved refactoring the ride model to allow separate entities for requester, payer, and rider. This service has processed 37M rides as of today.</li>
    <li>Starbucks integration: implemented API integration with Starbucks to allow their baristas to sign up with employee IDs and receive subsidized rides to their cafes.</li>
    <li>Events: mentored summer intern to implement <a href="https://lyft.com/events">Lyft events</a>. This allowed self-serve creation of batch Lyft coupons for event planners for holiday parties, and other events. I mentored the intern through designing the API, and helping have discussions with pay and fraud teams. This product handles approximately $200k in event revenue per anually.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Driver onboarding team</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Applicant tracking system for new Lyft drivers: this was the first Lyft microservice: written in Python with Flask, and Angular 3.0, and replaced the existing Salesforce funnel. I built optimizations as we scaled Lyft from four cities to over 100. The system has successfully onboarded more than 4.7M drivers today.</li>
    <li>Driver heatmaps: I built a back-end image tile service to show drivers in-demand areas to drive to while they were between rides. It ingested geohash data and produced choropleth image tiles. The service was built in 2015 and is still in use today.</li>
    <li>Mentoring system: As Lyft grew, it became infeasible for account executives to conduct phone screens and in-person interviews for new drivers. I helped implement a message queueing system, which paired top rated drivers with new applicants. The applicant would go for a test drive with the driver. The driver then filled out a checklist to assess the applicant. This enabled Lyft to easily grow into new cities without physical offices.</li>
</ul>
</p>

I built this in Java J2EE with Spring Framework and Hibernate on IBM WebSphere and Oracle 11g. I implemented both the back-end and front-end with guidance from a senior architect.</li>
<li>Developed a heat map web application prototype for Chorus using the Google Maps API V3 for Javascript. A screenshot of a map with dummy test data can be seen <a href="/images/map.png">here</a>. I implemented two overlays: weather data and real-time capacity information on a choropleth layer.</li>
