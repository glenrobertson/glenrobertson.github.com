            <ul>
                <li>Development of an application for Telecom New Zealand, which facilitated B2B communication between Chorus and Service Companies in a J2EE environment, using JAX-WS web services. The application was written in Spring Framework 2.5 and Hibernate on IBM WebSphere Application Server 7 and Oracle 11g. The web UI was written in JSP with Apache Tiles and JQuery. I was involved in the project from the requirements gathering phase to go-live.</li>
                <li>Developed a heat map web application prototype for Chorus using the Google Maps API V3 for Javascript. A screenshot of a map with dummy test data can be seen  <a href="/images/map.png">here</a>.<br />
                    I wrote two overlays: a weather overlay, which used JSONP to retrieve weather data; and a statistics overlay, which displayed real-time Chorus business statistics for New Zealand regions. The regions were made up of two sets of polygons at different zoom levels, coloured based on a predefined metric. The colours faded in real-time using statistics from a JSON feed.<br />
                    The prototype allowed Chorus to visualize their region based data across New Zealand and make decisions proactively. The heat map gained funding to turn into a final product as I was leaving, so I wrote a developer guide to ensure continued development went smoothly.</li>
                <li>Set up automated ANT builds and continuous integration using Hudson.</li>
                <li>Configured server clusters in UNIX environment.</li>
                <li>Wrote release notes and deployment instructions for staging and production environments.</li>
                <li>Worked in a small team of developers, testers, business analysts and project managers.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Developed web application to display diagnostic information about a selected shot within a scene of a film. This helped artists to see an overview of lighting, camera and other assets used within a shot. The initial development involved writing regular expressions to parse custom file metadata, and HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery to display the information.</li>
                <li>Rewrote a web application to allow artists to submit requests for show reels, and administrators to approve and generate the show reels. I simplified the existing web application by allowing the request process to take place using one screen, which replaced the existing 5-screen request process, making it easier for the artists to submit requests. Both web applications were developed in the Pylons framework for Python, with a RESTful web service architecture.</li>
                <li>Converted Perl CLI scripts to Python and upgrading the scripts to access an Apache Solr database, which resulted in a simple API for Solr access that other developers could reuse.</li>
