title: How I host this site for free using Github Pages
---


### Introduction
My first blog post is about this website! It is hosted for free on Github Pages and consists entirely of static files.

![Yo dawg, I heard you like blogs, so I blogged about how to set up a blog so you can blog while you blog](/images/yo-dawg-i-heard-you-like-blogs.jpg)

It is a good way to host your website if you:

* Only need to host static content such as HTML/CSS/images
* Have basic HTML/CSS and Git knowledge
* Prefer writing markdown in a text editor over a web-based blog editor
* Want free backups of your website (using Github)


### Create Github repository
The first thing you need to do is to set up a repository on github.com (signup for a free account if you haven't already). The repository name needs to be named your username + `.github.com`. For example, my username is `glenrobertson` and my repository name is `glenrobertson.github.com`. This repository is online here: https://github.com/glenrobertson/glenrobertson.github.com. 

After you have created the repository, Github Pages will host the static content of your repository on the URL with the same name as your repository name. In my case, I can go to `glenrobertson.github.com` in a browser and Github Pages will serve my `index.html` file if it is present in my repository.
